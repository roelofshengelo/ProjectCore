how will the player play the game?
player is god-like, omniscient to specific race and cannot be killed directly
- does need alive entities in current population to continue
- does not need research-discovering (research tree is completly known from the start)
- doesn't allways get first priority in orders

player is unit/group, unknowing-leader-unit in part of a larger community/race, can be killed by other entity
- does need alive entitie(s) in starting-race to continue
- does need need research-discovering (few/none research tree is known from the start)
- does get get first priority in orders

player is idea/conviction/resolution can be stopped/killd (technically)
- does need alive entitie in the universe to continue
